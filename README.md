# Idea

This repository encompasses flux workflows that help to analyse data/field structurs and return "instant" schemas.
They also count the total appearance of a field in all records aggregated or the appearence if a field is in a record n>0 times.

For the example in the morph folder you need a distribution created from the master branch of <https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core>. For that see:  <https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core/wiki/Flux-user-guide#installing-flux>

For the examples in the fix folder you need the runner from the newest release: https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-fix/releases/tag/0.4.0
